# BTC-Mapper
this program will allow you to track specific BTC addresses and keep track of their gains and losses. I plan on using this to find whale's 
that are trading large sums at a time to see if theyre making money or not. if they are, i plan on gathering a large group of them and then while using machine learning find a way to enter and exit the market in order to make make profits. 


next step is to create a graph that shows when the wallet made a positive return along with news articles that were out at the time
more advance version using Dash is to be created
-- further development on this will be made in the near future--
